# PlotNeuralNet/HighLevel

This is a very high level implementation of code provided by HarisIqbal88. Adds additional level of abstraction by using Python class to maintain information about current / past layers, in addition to adding functionality to image layers. There are no advanced layers in the class, such as Batch Norm, RELU, or multiple layers.

This may or may not be worked on in the future.
